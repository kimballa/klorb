"""Directory access control: Concrete `PermissionsTable` resource kind, governing
which directories klorb's file tools may read from and write to. See
docs/specs/permissions.md and docs/adrs/gate-read-hard-boundary-on-workspace-trust.md.

This module deliberately has no dependency on `klorb.tools` or `klorb.session`: `SessionConfig`
(in `klorb.session`) holds a `DirRules` field, so this module must not import `klorb.session` —
doing so would create a cycle. The policy functions that combine path resolution with the
tables defined here (`evaluate_write()`, `resolve_and_evaluate_read()`) live in
`klorb.permissions.workspace` instead, which needs a `ToolSetupContext` type (defined in
`klorb.tools.setup_context`, which itself depends on `klorb.session`) and so imports it under
`TYPE_CHECKING` only, avoiding the same cycle.
